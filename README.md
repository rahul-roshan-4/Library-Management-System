# Getting Started with Library Management App

To build the containers : **docker-compose build**
To run the containers : **docker-compose up**

# client: It is a react front end

# server: It is a node back end

# mysql : It is the database being used

# Ports:

Client of localhost at port _3000_ is mapped to the port _3000_ of container client
Server of localhost at port _5000_ is mapped to the port _5000_ of container server
Mysql Database of localhost at port _3306_ is mapped to the port _3306_ of container mysql

_PLEASE NOTE_ : The React frontend takes at least a minute to load. After the development server for the React frontend starts, which typically takes about a minute or two, it can be accessed via the link [http://localhost:3000].
